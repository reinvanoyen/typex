# typeX (in development)

typeX is a Sketch plugin which provides you with all the tools you need to export your text styles to the web platform, ready for your developer to put them to use. Instead of just giving you the typical simplistic copy-pastable CSS snippet for your text styles, you can now actually configure how to export them to css.

## Done
* Order text styles by size
* Export your text styles to a HTML fontbook (including text style name, CSS properties and preview text)
* Export text styles to basic JSON
 
## Todo
* Export CSS (as file OR copy-pastable directly) with each text style being a custom named class
* Export SASS (as file OR copy-pastable directly) with each text style being a custom named mixin
* Add option to customize the order in which to export the text styles (by font family, size, color, Sketch order, ...)
* Add option to exclude some text style properties
* Add more options for the HTML fontbook export to change the style of the exported document (background color, text color, ...)
